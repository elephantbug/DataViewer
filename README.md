Experimental WPF’s ICollectionView implementation based on Red-Black Tree.

This is just an experimental C# project that demonstrates my coding style. It does not work stable so do not use it in real-world applications.

See my blog post [Implementation of WPF’s ICollectionView interface](http://developernote.com/2015/06/implementation-of-wpfs-icollectionview-interface/) for more information.
